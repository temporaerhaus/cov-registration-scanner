Simple crappy scanner to check in with Corona-Warn-App vCard

Plug in a QR-Code Scanner via USB, that functions as a USB Keyboard (in the Verschw√∂rhaus: Datalogic Magellan 1500i) and a Receipt Printer. Then execute the scanloop.sh script. You can scan the vCard from the Corona-Warn-App or press the Enter Button to get an empty paper.
If you want to see, how many people were checked-in, type in 'stats' and press Enter.

(beta): To scan vaccination certificates, first execute updateDSCs.sh, then start scanloop.sh

Future Features: Scan and validate the vaccination certificate.
